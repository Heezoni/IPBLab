Prior to collaborating, we will endeavor to understand the technologies, implement their concepts, and show them to engineers.

      <h1>Design Research to Practice</h1>
      <p>Our lab aims to propose methods and design research
        directions that blend design research with practice.
        Most of the previous examples of design studies
        connected to practice are mainly products made
        by intuitions from stylistic and experienced designers.</p>
